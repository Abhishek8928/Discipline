/*

1. Using the console (repl)
   -> read , evaluate,computer,execution (expression),print,loop
   
2. variable
   -> a simply name of memory location where my variable are stored
   -> if we wanted to use some information throught the program is better to create a varaiable and stored in it 
   
3. datatype 
   -> 7 primitive or basic data type are (Number , String , Boolean , null , undefined , Symbol) 

4. Number 
   -> Negative and Positive
   -> integrer 
   -> float 
   -> typeof varaiable_name it will tell datatype of particular vraiable

5. Nan (Not a Number)
   -> A value that it represent that is not a valid number
   -> whatever the calculation we do with nan at output we will get nan
   example :- we cannot divide the 0

6. Opertor 
   -> +  , - , * (asterisk) , % Modulo operator (give remainder) , ** exponentation operator

7. Opertor percendence (genral order to solve any expression) priorty
   -> () solve the bracket
   -> ** solve the power solving rule right-left
   -> *,/,% solve from left to right
   -> +,-

8. Boolean -> a varaible that stored the true and false

9. Unary operator opration are performed on single operand
   a++ -> a= a+ 1 preincrement , postincrement , predecrement , preincrement
   preincrement (change , then use)
   postincrement (use , change)
   
10. let , const , var 
    -> var older syntax to declare the variable and it less secure 
    -> let  reassignment , change, it has block scope
    -> const blocked scope ,cannot reassignment , cannot change , declare and initization at same time creating a variable

11. String sequnces cahracter , words , paragraphs string should be enclosed with " " , ' '
    -> Best practise single character enclosed it by ' '  , paragraph or words " ";
    -> each character has assigned with index (or) position
    -> using length property we can get length of the string
    -> access the string charcter using index
    -> a index with start with 0 it know as 0 based index
    -> a empty space also have the index
    
12. identifer each variable should be unique identific
    -> start letter , $ , _ 
    -> contains number
    -> whitespace not allowed
    -> casesensitive ( Y and y) two different letter
    -> cannot use reserwed word
    -> text and js file differnces hai keyword ka
    
13. null and undefined
    -> a varaible which does initialized with value that it stored a placeholder undefined
    -> a thing which doesnot know by javascript then also we get undefined
    -> typeof undefined is undefined
    
    null
    -> we explicity assign to get absences of values and it will never occur in program
    -> typeof null is object
