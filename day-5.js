1. object literals is a key stored collection of complex entities
   -> object are nothing but the collection of property
   -> each property has key:value
   -> we can access the value with help of the key
   -> object can also helpful to stored complex entities entities with structured format
   -> to create a object we use {}
   -> a const object is same as the const array as we refer to refernces only

2. creating the object literals
   -> {
       name:"abhishek",
       age:"23",
       course:"bsc cs"
   }
   
3. access the object we have two method
   -> using dot operator object_name.key 
   -> object_name[pass the string as the key]
   
4. Update or add key in object
   -> access the object key and assign a new value
   -> access the object key and assign a new value if key is not present it will create a new property

5. delete a key in object
   -> delete operator help us to delete the object key
   -> delete object.key you wanted to delete

6. Math object has propertites and method for mathematical calculation
    -> Math.abs it is like mod
    -> Math.power(a,b) a is the base b is power alternate is ** (expontential operator)
    -> Math.floor(n) roundoff to smallest or equal integer
    -> Math.ceil(n) roundoff to largest or equal integer
    -> Math.random() genearte a random number 0 to 1 but not include or not exclusive 1

7. Math.random()
   -> Math.floor(Math.random()*max_number) + 1;
   -> reason why we adding 1 is that max_number last digits will never be geanerated because math.random only genearted 0 to 1 

Note : by defualt js convert each object key value as strings inside the object
event the key is number the number got converted to strings only
